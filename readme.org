#+TITLE: MaRCoS StemLAB Server

* Overview

  This is directly based on Thomas Witzel's ocra server, with some different methodology to support the MaRCoS GUI.
  
  Utilises the [[https://github.com/ludocode/mpack][MPack]] C library for server-client communications via the msgpack protocol.

  Currently there are two branches, =master= for the STEMlab-122.88, and =rp-125= for the STEMlab-125.
  Ultimately these will be merged and the target will be selected at compile-time.

* Setup

** Compilation
